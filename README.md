## Annotation tool

The  template aaif.dotm enables  the  creation  of  TEI-corresponding (“Text Encoding Initiative”, www.tei-c.org) XML-corpus documents 
(according to the version P5) via Microsoft Word. It offers users the opportunity to annotate texts while not engaging with the XML-structure 
of the final document. The relevant passages are directly annotated in Word by the use oftemplates orby the insertion oftext blocks.
